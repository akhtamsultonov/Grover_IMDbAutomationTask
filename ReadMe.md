`_Selenium-Cucumber-Java_ `

This repository contains a collection of sample selenium-cucumber-java projects and libraries that demonstrate how to use the tool and develop automation script using the Cucumber BDD framework with Java as programming language. It generates Cucumber HTML Report reporters as well. It also generates screen shots for your failed test cases.

I used different management and automation tools as `IntelliJ`, `Maven` for build management tool where in POM.XML file I store my dependencies and plugins, `Selenium WebDriver` for browser automation, `JUnit` for starting my tests and for assertions and `Cucumber`.
The necessary information such as _**URL**_ and **_Browser_** are inside my **Configuration-Properties** file and I am able to reach this information with the help of **Configuration Reader class**.

This framework is BDD, which uses Cucumber to write tests in `Features Package`, and under Features Package I created _Cucumber feature files_ where I used `GHERKIN` language in order to organize test suites. By using **Gherkin** I am making sure that my test cases are understandable for each member of my team, even for those who arenâ€™t technically strong

I have used **POM** structure in order to keep my codes organized and clean.
